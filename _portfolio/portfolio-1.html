<p>Rescue robot capable of moving in different terrains, developed based on the Robocup
2022 guidelines, implementing machine design, control algorithms and artificial vision.</p>
  
<p>Problem of flat belt tensioners in traction systems for a robotics competition in this case a Rescue Robot to participated in the “RoboCup” 
the biggest robotics competition in the world. 
The real challenge is to find a solution to a system that you cannot modify because this would represent great losses of money. 
So, designed a variable tensioner system for flat belts, ideal for traction and low cost taking into considerations
we are using aluminum sheets and common mechanical components.</p>


-Some of the characteristics of the tensors are:

<ul>
<li>Maintain the 180 ° contact angle with our pulleys, to take advantage of all the traction that our motors offer us</li>
<li>Height adjustable according to need</li>
<li>Top quality machine elements from the Mc Master Catalog</li>
<li>Adaptable to irregular surfaces and environments. Due to a compression spring system</li>
<li>No need to manually adjust</li>
<li>Easy installation process (DFMA)</li>
<li>Low Cost $50 USD</li>
</ul>
